TkCVS requires Tcl/Tk 8.4.  Tkcvs and tkdiff expect to find a
program called "wish" in the path.  This can be a symbolic link to wish8.x
or whatever is appropriate.  Naturally, you also need CVS and diff.

To install TkCVS, run "doinstall.tcl".  The installer provides an entry
containing the default path for installation, and it shows where it will put
the various files, On Unix/Linux, the default location is /usr/local, and on
Windows it's C:. If you want to put TkCVS somewhere else, type a new directory
in the entry and hit return.  doinstall.tcl can be run without the gui and with
an argument specifying the destination. 

Usage: [sudo] doinstall.tcl [-nox] [destination]


--- IMPORTANT: Configuration Files ---

Look at <install_dir>/lib/tkcvs/tkcvs_def.tcl and see if there's anything you
want to change.  You may need to change the variables which specify how to
invoke various programs and the location of the the temporary directory.  You
can also choose a default editor, specify colors for important tags, and set
many other preferences.

tkcvs_def.tcl will look for a file called site_def in the same directory
it is in.  That's a good place to put site-specific preferences such as tag
colours, without having them overwritten the next time you update tkcvs.

Also, you can put personal preferences in the .tkcvs file in your home
directory.  User interface preferences should usually go there.

This is the order of precedence:
 ~/.tkcvs
 <installdir>/lib/tkcvs/site_def
 <installdir>/lib/tkcvs/tkcvs_def.tcl

Some important preferences:
  cvscfg(editor) "xterm -e vi"
  cvscfg(shell) "xterm -name tkcvsxterm -n {TkCVS xterm}"
  

--------------------------------------
On Windows:

There's a Windows installer that includes diff.exe and tkdiff now.  You still
need to have Wish and CVS.

Or, you can use the .gz source tarball and install as for unix/linux.  In that
case, you will need to find diff.exe somewhere.  Make sure Wish, CVS, and diff
are in your PATH.  Also set CVSROOT.  If your version of Windows doesn't set
HOME, you should set that too.

It isn't recommended to use Cygwin to set up TkCVS for Windows, unless you're
using Cygwin versions of Wish and CVS also. The Windows version of Tcl won't
understand Cygwin's paths.

--------------------------------------

Aqua Tk on MacOSX:

Just drop TkCVS.app and TkDiff.app into your Applications folder.  No separate
Wish shell is necessary.  Pay attention to the .tkcvs file that's written in
your home directory when TkCVS is run.  You may want to specify a different
editor or shell:

set cvscfg(editor) /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit
