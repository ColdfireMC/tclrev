TkRev requires Tcl/Tk 8.5.  Tkrev and tkdiff expect to find a program
called "wish" in the path.  This can be a symbolic link to wish8.x or whatever
is appropriate.  You also need a unix-like diff program, and whatever revision
control systems you want to use. TkRev supports CVS, RCS, Subversion, and
Git.

To install TkRev, run "wish doinstall.tcl".  The installer provides an
entry containing the default path for installation, and it shows where it will
put the various files, On Unix/Linux, the default location is /usr/local, and
on Windows it's C:. If you want to put TkRev somewhere else, type a new
directory in the entry and hit return.  On MacOS, /opt/local may be a good
choice.

doinstall.tcl can be run without the gui, with an optional argument
specifying the destination. 

Usage: [sudo] wish doinstall.tcl
   or: [sudo] tcl doinstall.tcl [-nox] [destination]


--- IMPORTANT: Configuration Files ---

Look at <install_dir>/lib/tkrev/tkrev_def.tcl and see if there's anything you
want to change.  You may need to change the variables which specify how to
invoke various programs and the location of the the temporary directory.  You
can also choose a default editor, specify colors for important tags, and set
many other preferences.

tkrev_def.tcl will look for a file called site_def in the same directory
it is in.  That's a good place to put site-specific preferences such as tag
colours, without having them overwritten the next time you update tkrev.

Also, you can put personal preferences in the .tkrev file in your home
directory.  User interface preferences should usually go there.

This is the order of precedence:
 ~/.tkrev
 <installdir>/lib/tkrev/site_def
 <installdir>/lib/tkrev/tkrev_def.tcl

Some important preferences:
  cvscfg(editor) - Set this to your preferred text editor
  cvscfg(shell)  - What terminal do you want when you ask for a shell?
