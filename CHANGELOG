Release 8.0.4

- Fix [ 1483057 ] Empty Branch Diagram for deleted files (TkSVN)
  If a file had been removed from the trunk and was diagrammed from a
  branch, some or all of the diagram could be missing.

- Fix [ 1673519 ] tcl error with SVN->Browse the Log Diagram

- Ask for confirmation before reverting files

- Display TkCVS version in window title of workdir and module browsers.

- Don't fail if CVS gives a date format that tcl can't handle

- Added a button for a text history log of the file to the branch browser.

- The "New Directory" button is back

- cvscfg(svn_branch_filter) and cvscfg(svn_branch_max_count) to filter
  which branches to draw in the log browser


Release 8.0.3   March, 2006

- Automatic tagging of merges works for SVN the same as CVS

- Working directory browser observes svn_ignore

- Clean up some filenames-with spaces issues

- TkDiff 4.1.3


Release 8.0.2   January, 2006

- Fix error in Branch Diagram when searching for merge tags

- cvscfg(mergetrunkname) option to replace the literal "trunk" in the code
  with an arbitrary string

- Branch Browser in SVN will diff a single selection in the tree with the
  file in the current directory

- Fix strange "SVN Path" in top entry of Branch Browser (only cosmetic)

- Lengthen maximum length of error message to trigger an error popup in
  exec.  That lets a cvs log failure due to a permission problem tell us
  what went wrong.


Release 8.0.1   January, 2006

- Fix a couple of undefined variables

- Add log button to workdir browser and change the cvs_log function to
  eliminate post-processing, using syntax highlighting instead


Release 8.0     December, 2005

- The Annotation browser optionally shows line numbers.

- Multiple branch-browser fixes for Subversion: 
  - Treat branchpoints as real revisions, so they have both a blue box and
    a black one in the diagram.  It's rather inelegant, but it works with the
    way the branch browser was designed.  Solves problem of branches not
    being drawn if they branch straignt from another branchpoint.
  - Send URL paths instead of -r <file> arguments to the diff, svn-cat, and
    annotation commands because Subversion doesn't cross branch boundaries with
    simple revision arguments, and doesn't tell you that it's not giving you
    the revision you asked for.
  - Bugfix: relative URL path in Branch Browser is constructed correctly for
    path depths > 2

- The Branch Browser counts the tags when making a Subversion diagram and gives
  you a chance to skip the tag step if there are many, where "many" is defined
  by cvscfg(toomany_tags).  Constructing the branch diagram for Subversion is
  extremely inefficient, and drawing the tags can take longer than it's worth.

- For Subversion directories, the Module Browser shows the number of items
  within the folder instead of the "svn list -v" info string.  That may
  help you decide whether to open the folder or not.

- The Branch Browser positions the diagram so "you are here" is in the visible
  canvas, fixing a long-time nagging irritation.


Release 8.0b1   December, 2005

- TkCVS now supports Subversion.  This involved a major re-organization of the
  program, and many things have changed a little.  The program will detect
  which revision-control system a directory is under and react appropriately.
  The previously undocumented RCS support is explicit now and has been enhanced
  somewhat.

- Command line "tkcvs <file>" will open the log browser without the -log
  option.

- The annotation browser estimates how many days per color or revs per color to
  use, so cvscfg(dayspercolor) and cvscfg(revspercolor) are gone.  You can
  still change it per file in the annotation browser.

- The directory-level CVS Merge Tool has a pull-down with a list of the tags,
  to make it easier to "merge since" a tag.

- TkDiff 4.1.1, which has a security patch.


Release 7.2.4   July, 2005

- Fix problem with confirmation dialog


Release 7.2.3   July, 2005

- Close file descriptor for stderr output, which could exhaust the
  maximum number of open files.

- Re-work the pop-up dialogs so they appear in the center of their parent
  window, not the middle of the screen (or between the two screens.)

- The branch browser can now diff two versions even if it was invoked from
  the Module Browser and the file isn't checked out.

- TkDiff 4.1 (Tk8.4 recommended but not required)

- The bookmarks stay in alphabetical order.


Release 7.2.2   November, 2004

- Handle UTF time format in cvs 1.12.8 log.  The author field no longer
  gets lost during parsing.

- Modify the exec module so that it gives back the GUI while the background
  process is running

- If using an external editor for commit messages (use_cvseditor), don't
  display the dialog but go straight to the editor.

- New menu functions to set or unset the -kb (keyword-binary) flag

- Added a button to save the contents of a log-viewer window to a file

- Choose whether to update the working directory after branching.  TkCVS has
  always updated the working directory to be on the new branch, though
  cvs itself doesn't do that.  Now TkCVS gives you the choice.

- Change the cvs log options so the merging tool doesn't have a problem
  with certain combinations of cvs clients and servers (1.10 client and
  1.12 server was one such bad combination)

- Fix default cvscfg(editor).  The defaults are now
  set cvscfg(editor) "xterm"
  set cvscfg(editorargs) "-e vi"
 
- TkDiff 4.0.2


Release 7.2.1   April, 2004

- Vendor Merge is back, rehabilitated by Eugene Lee, its author.

- Bug fixes:
  892051 apply the tag ignores user input
  892050 merge changes to current doesn't do that
  (No report) Clear entry containing tag instead of appending, so tag
     doesn't grow if dialog is re-opened.
  Fixed a few problems with defaults in tkcvs_def.tcl.

- The installer no longer hardcodes the library path in tkcvs.  The program
  now figures out where it is at runtime.

- You can now configure how many lines to keep in the trace window with
  $cvscfg(trace_savelines)

- Import dialog has better defaults.  Version default is the same as
  you get if you don't supply the -b option on the command line.

- Don't show stderr in CVS Commit dialog, since if there are many directories
  they may make too much output and make you miss what you were interested in.


Release 7.2     January 1, 2004

- More merging functionality.  Helps you tag the merged-from and merged-to
  versions, and if you use the tagnames properly, draws curving arrows between
  them to show where merges occurred.  The tagnames are configurable with the
  cvscfg(mergetoformat) and cvscfg(mergefromformat) variables.

- Requires Tk 8.4 for the curved lines.

- Fixed bug in annotation browser wherein it didn't change colors when
  "Days per Color" changed.

- No longer pops an error dialog if the background exec fails.  Just beeps at
  you.  The command's output should tell you what happened.

- TkDiff v4.0:
      "r" key binding to recompute diffs
      fix for diff symbols in Change Bars disappearing
      preferences for showing whitespace differences
      better tolerance of Windows filenames


Release 7.1.4   November 6, 2003

- Bugfix for hangs in 7.1.3

- Bugfix for uninitialized X1 coordinate


Release 7.1.3   October 20, 2003

- Compatible with CVS 1.11.8, which lost the global -l flag.

- Mainline tkdiff is back.  Tkdiff is on Sourceforge now and there's an
  official beta, which is pretty stable.

- Annotation browsing is available from the log branch browser.  There's also
  a button on the main window to make it more likely that people will discover
  the function, which can be most useful.

- Merging will work to the branch as well as to the trunk in the logcanvas
  browser.

- Solved a few problems with the exec functionality.  High CPU usage is gone.
  It now gives back the UI (to one degree or another) and captures stderr (both)
  instead of doing one or the other.

- Made a filter for single-line module-diff (patch) output.  Now files that
  were added, removed, or changed are easier to pick out visually.

- Added an Apply button to the module-level checkout, export, and patch
  dialogs.  Since they don't save state, you could have to type the same
  thing over and over on subsequent operations.


Release 7.1.2   December 21, 2002

- Fix exec problems.  Exit status is detected properly.  There's a new trace
  level so you can see what CVS says on stderr.

- Log browser no longer gives a stack trace if it can't figure out where to put
  the "you are here" guy.  It just draws the diagram without him.

- The correct highlight foreground is used in the canvas so the highlighted text
  is readable with Windows color schemes.

- Directory-level merge now picks up new directories (-d flag.)  It should be
  an option, but you get bitten worse without -d than with it.


Release 7.1.1  November 13, 2002

- Fix right-mouse button problem that showed up in the contextual popup for the
  current directory canvas.  Fixed an area-select problem while I was at it.

- Fix reversed -j arguments in the merge_diff dialog

- Required Tk version is 8.3, not 8.1


Release 7.1  November 10, 2002

- New graphical tool to help with merging directories and seeing an overview
  of the branches.

- New, completely re-written, branching diagram.  Much more sensible and
  pleasing to the eye.  Contributed by Mike Jagdis

- You can invoke the log browser from the command line:
  tkcvs [-dir directory] [-root cvsroot] [-win workdir|module] [-log file]
  Saves a lot of time if you're working with a remote repository and you
  only want to browse one file.  Contributed by John Lash.

- Option to use an external editor for commit messages so the rcsinfo template
  feature can be used.  Terminal-based editors only for now, unless you don't mind
  a superfluous shell window popping up in addition to your GUI-based editor.
  Contributed by Mike Jagdis.

- A picklist keeps a temporary history of directories visited.  Favorite places
  can be bookmarked.

- Capability to browse RCS files, in case you find yourself in an
  rcs-controlled directory.  You can't do checkins and checkouts, but you can
  see which files are under RCS control, which ones differ from the checked-in
  version, and who has them locked.

- A heavily patched TkDiff that works in AquaTK, in case you're a MacOS X fan.
  TkCVS does pretty well in AquaTK as-is, with a few tweaks to tkcvs_def.tcl.

- More intuitive module-operation dialogs contributed by Mike Jagdis.

- Re-arranged buttons.  There's a somewhat overwhelming array, but now almost
  everything is there without resorting to the menus.  I've tried to organize
  them helpfully.  In addition, the ones that do CVS functions are disabled
  when in a non-CVS directory.

- The ".." directory has been removed from the browser, and we now have a
  "go up" button instead.  Saves space in the list and keeps people from doing
  unfortunate things to ".."

- Namespace problems eliminated in log browser.  Now you can have as many
  open as you like.  Contributed by Mike Jagdis

- Improved viewer for command output.  It has multi-command capability.
  That is used to advantage by the import routine, which used to open "waaaay
  too many windows."  Contributed by Mike Jagdis

- Smoother (faster?) scrolling in the directory and module browsers, due to
  eliminating the windows-within-a-canvas method of drawing icons.
  Contributed by John Cerney.

- Patch for filtering and color coding "cvs update" output, contributed by
  Laurent Duperval.

- Since there are more ways you can start tkcvs, the exiting had to be cleaned
  up so you don't accidentally exit, or worse, leave a windowless wish running.
  Contributed by Mike Jagdis.

- Enhanced dialog for importing a module.  Contributed by Mike Jagdis

- Always sort by filename so that even if the files are sorted some other way,
  they are sub-sorted in alphabetical order.

- If the edit file button is clicked with nothing selected, a dialog box pops
  up to allow input of a (new?) file name rather than erroring.  (Mike Jagdis)

- There was a call to "cat" in exec.tcl.  It's gone now, so Windows users don't
  have to have cat.exe anymore.

- Repaired a bug in which if you did an import and the "Group Aliases in a
  Folder" option was set, the aliases would be duplicated in the browser.

- These days X is usually set up to map mouse wheel motion to button 4/5
  events.  Patch adds bindings for buttons for and 5 so that the mouse wheel
  can be used to scroll under X.  (Mike Jagdis)


Release 7.0.3  January 23, 2002

- Improved the algorithm for building the tree in the module browser, making
  it less error-prone.

- Recursive add respects .cvsignore and $cvscfg(ignore_file_filter)

- The Working Directory Browser parses the "Sticky Options" field and uses
  a different icon if a locally-added or up-to-date file is binary (-kb).

- The Log Browser color-codes the selected revisions so you can visually
  match the log text with the box in the branching diagram.

- The dialog for module-level tagging (cvs rtag) is a little more
  informative (and the code is a little less rococo).

- The installer has a new option "-finaldest", to facilitate building
  debian-style packages.

- The man page is installed in man1 instead of mann.

- The tooltips no longer persist until the operation started by the button
  is finished.


Release 7.0.2  October 19, 2001

- Fixed duplicate items when using Control-B1 to add items to the selection
  in the workdir browser.

- Several bugfixes to the module browser.  You can now have "&" composites
  at the end of a nested module without blowing it out of the graphical
  tree structure.  Also fixed bugs in finding a module's title and choosing
  the right icon.

- The ability to group alias modules in their own folder is back, but as an
  option cvscfg(aliasfolder).  It defaults to true.

- There's now an Options menu in the module browser to turn tracing on and
  off and temporarily change the display of alias modules.

- New "File->Module File" item in the module browser menu displays the
  CVSROOT/modules file in a text window.

- Do a "file join" on the CVSROOT variable to put it in the native
  path format.  That helps with a PC and a Samba-mounted repository
  and doesn't seem to hurt anything else.


Release 7.0.1  September 3, 2001

- By popular demand, made file selection in the main canvas conform more to
  the Shift-click-adds-range and Ctrl-click-adds-single model.

- Made the CDE parameter thing more bullet-proof.  It shouldn't fail if
  something is missing now.

- After a module import, it renames the original directory and checks out
  into a fresh one.  Otherwise, the checkout isn't recursive and you get a
  lot of "independently added by a second party" messages.

- Commented out the tkwaits that were causing the commit and merge dialogs
  to disappear in some window managers.  Unfortunately they may have to
  be un-commented back on some systems, especially Mandrake, which seems to
  exhibit timing problems sometimes.

- If a file's log message had a line containing only "=" characters, the
  logcanvas browser would drop all the revisions that came after it.  It will
  still do it if there are exactly 77 equal signs, but not otherwise.


Release 7.0   June 2, 2001

- Improved main file-browsing window.  It now has icons to indicate the status
  of the files.  The right mouse button activates context-sensitive popup menus.
  As a consequence of using a canvas widget instead of a listbox, the selection
  mechanism is different.  It's click to select, shift-click to add selection,
  click-on-background to deselect all.  The right button does an area select.

- The module browser reads whatever information is available in the
  modules file via "cvs checkout -c" before it looks for the tkcvs-specific
  extensions.  Thus if there is a modules file at all, some information
  will be available without the additional comments.

- Options are specified via the options database instead of with cvscfg
  variables.  If the window manager is CDE, its options are used by default.

- The state of the main windows is remembered between sessions.

- Bugs in display of the Editors column are fixed.

- Finally found a good home for the "Checkout with Options" dialog.  Someone
  pointed out that it belongs in the File menu next to the simple Update item.
  I'm convinced that that's right.

- The module browser window is paned so that you can adjust the relative
  width of the columns.

- CVS version 1.11 is supported better.


Release 6.4  October 12, 2000

- An optional column to show who's editing, and buttons to edit and unedit. 

- The file list can be sorted up or down by each column. 

- Filenames containing spaces are now permissible. 

- Some configuration options can be saved. 

- Most output windows are searchable.

- New reports 
  - cvs annotate 
  - cvs log showing only the latest commit 

- Option to show only a few tags for each revision in the branch browser. 

- Some bug fixes. 

- TkCVS 6.4 requires Tcl/Tk8.1 or better! Sorry, 8.0 has problems on too many
  platforms. Besides, a regular expression parser that doesn't understand
  [\s\t]+ just isn't good enough. :-( 

Release 6.3

  The bugfixes have finally caught up with the new features,
  and we are declaring a stable release.

  This is the first release that runs "native" on Windows - that is, without
  either the Cygnus emulation layer or a whole lot of fiddling.

Release 6.3.b2 (bugfix)

- Fix the tag dialog so that it can be invoked more than once.

- Insert "tkwait visibility" before "wm withdraw" for the larger dialogs
  to avert race conditions which occurred on slower framebuffers.

Release 6.3.b1

-  New graphical Module Browser.  I reworked a BWidget implementation that
   was contributed by Marcel Koelewijn.  Then I moved some of the buttons and
   menus from the workdir to the module browser if they seemed more related
   to modules than to the working directory.  Then I updated the help text to
   reflect the changes.

-  The GUI and listbox fonts are now configurable.

-  TkCVS now looks for a file called "site_def" in the installation directory.
   That's a good place to define your tagcolours and other site-specific
   things.  It won't be overwritten by installs like tkcvs_def.tcl is.

-  Some contributions by Andrew Johnson:
     Added the ability to select an editor based on a pattern match on the
        filename (eg to launch gimp on .gif files, etc).  User configurable
        with the cvscfg(editors) variable and it defaults to the cvscfg(editor)
        setting for backwards compatibility.
     Fixed scrolling in the workdir listboxes so they remain synchronized if
        you drag one up or down with the middle mouse button.
 
-  User-configurable debug output, contributed by Marcel Koelewijn.  Tinkerers
     will like this.

-  Featurecide:
     Buttons are always graphical and tooltips are always on.  You don't have
        a choice anymore.
     Log level "last" was removed because it didn't seem to work.
        You can't count on the most recent checkin coming first or last,
        especially on a branch.
     Support for old versions of CVS was removed.

-  Replaced the calls to awk with internal tcl parsing.  It slows down
   the workdir listing some, but it solves portability problems and it's
   cleaner.  Also replaced execs of rm, mv, and cp with tcl file commands.

-  Put scrollbars on the text windows in the Log Browser so you can see how
   long the log messages are.

-  Put a fill color in the revision rectangles in the log browser so that
   you can select them by clicking anywhere instead of just on the border.

-  Added a conflict-merge proc, translated from a shell script by Bryan Ogawa.

-  Between Marcel and me, the Vendor Merge functionality is rehabilitated,
   working with remote repositories, and using the new module browser.
   At least I think it's working.

-  And of course I've been messing with the icons.


Release 6.2.b3

-  Added a button to the filebrowser to list the tags of a file.

-  Fixed a bug in logbrowsing from the filebrowser.

-  Scroll to the top of log canvas, so the most recent activity shows first.

-  Changed the bitmap for iconified workdir and module windows.


Release 6.2.b2

-  Fixed the invocation of the logbrowser from the module filelist.


Release 6.2.b1

-  Made tkcvs more remote-client friendly by replacing all calls which
   change directory to the repository with CVS commands.  You can now
   get a file list from the Module Browser remotely, although it can be slow.

-  Colorized the icons.

-  Fixed the module browser so it will display directory trees that
   are more than two levels deep.

-  Made the reports behave the way the help file says they do.
   The 'by name' lists weren't confined to the selected module
   like the helpfile said, but now they are.

-  Prevent "runaway tkdiff."  If no file is selected, tell the user to
   select one.

-  Display "sticky tags" in the logcanvas browser.  Fixed another
   branching bug.  The x offsets of the tag labels aren't perfect -
   we'll have to do a real place-and-route algorithm some day.

-  Added a checkbox for the -F argument to cvs tag, because everyone
   argues about whether it should force or not.  Let's let them
   decide.

-  Folded in some more changes to help it run on Windows.

-  Fixed the "Go" menu so it remembers where we've been.  Don't know
   when that got broken.


Release 6.1.a8:

-  Quotes in comment strings stopped passing thru when exec_command was
   implemented.  Added a regsub to fix it.  Dollar signs are still OK.

-  Changed "rsh -l user host" to "rsh host -l user" because some
   implementations of rsh don't understand the former.

-  Fixed some erratic behavior when a remote module file isn't read
   successfully.

-  read the .cvsignore file in the working directory and add it to
   the ignore patterns which were optionally set in tkcvs_def.

-  Bugfix: filter "no file xyz" out of getFiles so it doesn't try to commit them.

Release 6.1.a7:

-  Jo Wahle has redone building the workdir columns so it's much faster, and
   fixed a bug in which merge conflicts would cause it to get confused.

-  I parsed the branch info from the cvs log to take the guesswork
   out of the branching tree.
 
-  Stephen Kick improved logcanvas sizing so tags on the top
   revision don't disappear off the top of the canvas.

Release 6.1.a6:

-   Fix some bugs.  Put in a dialog to tell you if your rsh to a cvs
    server failed.  Fixed the listing of arguments in the "are you sure?"
    dialog.  Improved the logcanvas' ability to find a parent node
    in a strange revision sequence.


Release 6.1.a5:

-   Put in some configuration options to run on DOS/Windows.  Contributed
    by Christoph Jaeschke.

    NOTE:  I don't have a Wintel machine to test on (strange but true.)
    The configuration options are only tested on unix.

-   Changed the report commands to run under exec_command.  I missed 
    some last time.

Release 6.1.a4:

-   Run lengthy cvs operations in the background to avoid locking up the
    GUI.  Contributed by Christoph Jaeschke.

-   Upgrade tkdiff from v2.03 to 3.0-beta-6, which looks like it's going
    to be final.  Tkdiff has its own editor preference now, so we don't
    have to kludge one in at install time.

-   The cvscheck script is integrated into the tcl code.  Contributed
    by Christoph Jaeschke.

Release 6.1.a3: 

-   Bugfixes.  Module browser looks at the repository that the current
    CVS directory is in.  TkDiff2.03 is patched so that it will work with
    two un-checked-out files.

Release 6.1.a2: 

-   Upgrade from tkdiff v1.0 to v2.03

-   Fix the bug in the module browser so that the current module always
    matches the X selection.

-   Added command-line options
    -dir directory
    -root cvsroot
    -win (workdir|module)

-   Logfile browser doesn't try to evaluate dollar signs in comments
    anymore, so you can use them with impunity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 6.1.a1 was put together by Dorothy Robinson. It contains bugfixes and
enhancements provided by users.  Please don't blame Del for my mistakes.
In general, I rolled in patches but didn't do anything with suggestions
unless they were very simple. The most noticeable changes are:

-   Showing the current tag of each file and the directory in the main
    window, so users know right away whether they are on a branch or not.
    Providing more information and options in the update dialog box.
    This group of changes was contributed by Jo Wahle.  It reflects use
    in a production environment where users are sometimes inexperienced.
    It's informative without getting in the way, I think.

-   The install script has been updated for Wish8.0, and it should now
    work on FreeBSD.

-   ~/.tkcvs is sourced on startup.

-   The help file no longer talks about marking files, which was obsolete.

-   The log browser has been reworked to show the tagnames and to draw branches
    more intelligently, making better use of horizontal space.  Blame me for
    this one.

-   Import checks out the modules file before trying to change it.  This
    was from  M.E. Smith.
