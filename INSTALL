TkCVS requires Tcl/Tk 8.5.  Tkcvs and tkdiff expect to find a
program called "wish" in the path.  This can be a symbolic link to wish8.x
or whatever is appropriate.  You also need a unix-like diff program, and whatever
revision control systems you want to use. TkCVS supports CVS, RCS, Subversion,
and Git.

To install TkCVS, run "wish doinstall.tcl".  The installer provides an entry
containing the default path for installation, and it shows where it will put
the various files, On Unix/Linux, the default location is /usr/local, and on
Windows it's C:. If you want to put TkCVS somewhere else, type a new directory
in the entry and hit return.  On MacOS, /opt/local may be a good choice.

doinstall.tcl can be run without the gui, with an optional argument
specifying the destination. 

Usage: [sudo] wish doinstall.tcl
   or: [sudo] tcl doinstall.tcl [-nox] [destination]


--- IMPORTANT: Configuration Files ---

Look at <install_dir>/lib/tkcvs/tkcvs_def.tcl and see if there's anything you
want to change.  You may need to change the variables which specify how to
invoke various programs and the location of the the temporary directory.  You
can also choose a default editor, specify colors for important tags, and set
many other preferences.

tkcvs_def.tcl will look for a file called site_def in the same directory
it is in.  That's a good place to put site-specific preferences such as tag
colours, without having them overwritten the next time you update tkcvs.

Also, you can put personal preferences in the .tkcvs file in your home
directory.  User interface preferences should usually go there.

This is the order of precedence:
 ~/.tkcvs
 <installdir>/lib/tkcvs/site_def
 <installdir>/lib/tkcvs/tkcvs_def.tcl

Some important preferences:
  cvscfg(editor) - Set this to your preferred text editor
  cvscfg(shell)  - What terminal do you want when you ask for a shell?
